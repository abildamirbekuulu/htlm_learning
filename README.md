The HTML file (index.html) defines a survey form containing various input fields and question prompts.
It includes form elements such as text input fields for name and email, a dropdown for selecting roles, radio buttons for recommendations, checkboxes for preferences, and a textarea for comments.
CSS Styling:

The CSS file (styles.css) styles the form's layout, alignment, and appearance.
It sets the form width, centers the form elements, and aligns the title, description, and form inputs for better readability.
Different form elements like labels, inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, and buttons have specific styles regarding margins, padding, and width to ensure consistency and visual appeal.
The overall form has a pleasing aesthetic with a dark background color and white text for readability.
Functionality:
